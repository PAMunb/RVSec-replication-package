### Bench02

   * Description: `Bench02` is a micro-benchmark we build on top of the
   CryptoAPI-Bench. From the original benchmark (CryptoAPI-Bench), we
   removed the non JCA test cases and fixed several test cases that
   throw exceptions at runtime. The following table summarizes the
   runtime problems that we faced from the original CryptoAPI-Bench. 


   * Tools:
   
      * CryptoGuard (rev 92551eeb)
